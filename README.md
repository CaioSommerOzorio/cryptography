# Cryptography

A command line cryptography tool made in C++ to encode/decode strings of text

# Usage:
Compile src.cpp (works with g++)

To encode:

`./a.out en -m {mode} -s {string to be encoded} -k {key}`

Example:

`./a.out en -m caesar -s hello world -k 8`


Decoding is the same, just use `de` instead of `en`

# Added encoding/decoding methods:
Caesar cipher: encoding

# Encoding/Decoding Methods to be added:
Caesar cipher: decoding
